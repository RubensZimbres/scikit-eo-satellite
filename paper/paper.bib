abstract = {This article focuses on the identification, categorization and discussion of the significant contribution of anthropogenic and climatic factors in forest degradation in a region south of Peru. A combination of existing dataset, spatial analysis, classification techniques, linear regression and logistic regression were used to identify, categorize and explore the key factors related to forest degradation. For the identification of areas in degradation we used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for gradual changes and Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) for abrupt and accelerated changes in plant cover. The results demonstrated that the first indicator allowed to identify negative gradual trends, but also abrupt negative trends that in total represented 69.8% of the total degraded areas at a 95% reliability, while the second indicator allowed to identify the abrupt changes not identified by the first indicator, contributing with 30.2% to the identification of the degradation. On the other hand, our categorization resulted in three levels of degradation, i.e. low, moderate and high with 73.6%, 5.8% and 20.6% respectively of the total degraded areas. These different levels of degradation were mainly reflected by the contribution of anthropogenic factors such as gold mining, agriculture and human footprint. In addition, we developed a degradation risk map and showed that areas with a probability of degradation of less than 0.5 can become highly degraded regions in the medium and long term, causing serious repercussions on the environment and biodiversity. Therefore, the results of this work constitute a core of knowledge so that managers can make planning decisions properly.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach of change detection that reduces seasonality in time series by using Photosynthetic Vegetation Time Series (PVTS) from satellite images. With this approach, each pixel value represents at the subpixel level a fraction of the photosynthetic forest’s activity. Our hypothesis is based on an assumption that photosynthetic vegetation fractions will remain constant until a disturbing agent (natural or anthropic) occurs. Using Landsat data, we compared our approach with the Carnegie Landsat Systems Analysis-Lite (CLASlite) approach and with the national reports of the Ministry of the Environment of Perú (MINAM). After reducing seasonal variations in Landsat data, we detected deforestation events with a new detection method. Our approach (which was called PVts-β) of detection is a simple method that does not model the seasonality and it only requires as inputs: i) the average and standard deviation of the time series of a pixel and ii) a threshold magnitude (β) that was calibrated to detect deforestation events in tropical forests. For the PVts-β approach, the results of calibration show that deforestation was optimally detected for β = (5,6), higher or lower than this range, the biases favor to false detections and favor the omission of deforestation too. On the other hand, the overall accuracy for the PVts-β approach was 91.1%, with an omission and commission of 8.3% and 0.5% respectively, while for CLASlite the overall accuracy was 79.2%, with an omission and commission of 20.8% and 0.0% respectively. The differences in the overall accuracy between the PVts-β and CLASlite approach were significant, being atmospheric noise a main problem which CLASlite usually does not work optimally. The strength of our PVts-β approach is the early detection at the subpixel level of deforestation events that, added to our new method of change detection explain the little omission obtained in the results. Therefore, the PVts-β approach -that we propose here- provides the opportunity to monitoring deforestation events in tropical forests at sub-annual scales using Landsat data, and it can be used for near-real-time change detection monitoring without a doubt.}

abstract = {The remote sensing science and application communities have developed increasingly reliable, consistent, and robust approaches for capturing land dynamics to meet a range of information needs. Statistically robust and transparent approaches for assessing accuracy and estimating area of change are critical to ensure the integrity of land change information. We provide practitioners with a set of “good practice” recommendations for designing and implementing an accuracy assessment of a change map and estimating area based on the reference sample data. The good practice recommendations address the three major components: sampling design, response design and analysis. The primary good practice recommendations for assessing accuracy and estimating area are: (i) implement a probability sampling design that is chosen to achieve the priority objectives of accuracy and area estimation while also satisfying practical constraints such as cost and available sources of reference data; (ii) implement a response design protocol that is based on reference data sources that provide sufficient spatial and temporal representation to accurately label each unit in the sample (i.e., the “reference classification” will be considerably more accurate than the map classification being evaluated); (iii) implement an analysis that is consistent with the sampling design and response design protocols; (iv) summarize the accuracy assessment by reporting the estimated error matrix in terms of proportion of area and estimates of overall accuracy, user's accuracy (or commission error), and producer's accuracy (or omission error); (v) estimate area of classes (e.g., types of change such as wetland loss or types of persistence such as stable forest) based on the reference classification of the sample units; (vi) quantify uncertainty by reporting confidence intervals for accuracy and area parameters; (vii) evaluate variability and potential error in the reference classification; and (viii) document deviations from good practice that may substantially affect the results. An example application is provided to illustrate the recommended process.}

Based on the CA-Markov model, this study predicts the spatial patterns of land use in 2025 and 2036 based on the dynamic changes in land use patterns using remote sensing and geographic information system. CA-Markov integrates the advantages of cellular automata and Markov chain analysis to predict future land use trends based on studies of land use changes in the past. Based on Landsat 5 TM images from 1992 and 2003 and Landsat 8 OLI images from 2014, this study obtained a land use classification map for each year. Then, the genetic transition probability from 1992 to 2003 was obtained by IDRISI software. Based on the CA-Markov model, a predicted land use map for 2014 was obtained, and it was validated by the actual land use results of 2014 with a Kappa index of 0.8128. Finally, the land use patterns of 2025 and 2036 in Jiangle County were determined. This study can provide suggestions and a basis for urban development planning in Jiangle County.},

This study highlights remote sensing discoveries that were not detected by climate models or conventional observations, and suggests future challenges for the robust determination of climate trends. Satellite remote sensing has provided major advances in understanding the climate system and its changes, by quantifying processes and spatio-temporal states of the atmosphere, land and oceans. In this Review, we highlight some important discoveries about the climate system that have not been detected by climate models and conventional observations; for example, the spatial pattern of sea-level rise and the cooling effects of increased stratospheric aerosols. New insights are made feasible by the unparalleled global- and fine-scale spatial coverage of satellite observations. Nevertheless, the short duration of observation series and their uncertainties still pose challenges for capturing the robust long-term trends of many climate variables. We point out the need for future work and future systems to make better use of remote sensing in climate change studies.},

   abstract = {Introduction: The application of remote-sensing techniques for water quality assessment has become increasingly popular in China. However, existing reviews are often limited to qualitative description and are quite fragmented. Outcomes: We conducted a quantitative systematic review to display current research status and identify the existing challenges and future directions. Our review revealed that the application of remote-sensing techniques in water quality research has expanded dramatically in China, but the spatial distribution is quite uneven. Second, the ground object spectrometer is the most widely applied data source. Water color indicators such as chlorophyll a and suspended solid are the most widely investigated in China. Third, semiempirical method is the most commonly used inversion method. Existing studies rarely considered the anthropogenic factors, which limited the model robustness and its application in human-dominated aquatic ecosystems. Discussion and Conclusion: We concluded that, in the past several decades, China has made notable progresses in monitoring and evaluation of water quality using the remote-sensing techniques (especially in inland lakes). We proposed that further improvements would be needed in terms of temporal and spatial coverage, indicator list, the incorporation of human–nature interactions, inversion accuracy, and model generalization.},

   abstract = {Air pollution is the atmospheric state in which specific elements concentrations has adverse impacts on human health as well as the environment including global warming, transportation, acidic rain, and ozone layer depletion. Currently, population around the world lives in urban areas coupled with population size in addition to the increasing levels of vehicles which led to deterioration in air quality. Additionally, the clean air is a critical and vital element for environment and health of any region. Therefore, the foci of this research are to detect the air pollution parameters and investigate the relationship with the meteorological parameters including temperature, and wind speed along Al-Shamal train pathway in Al-Qurayyat City in Saudi Arabia using satellite data. This study involved various field visits to distribute questionnaires to residents to gain information about their health status and get their opinions about air quality. The questionnaires analysis manifested poor air quality conditions and thermal pollution due to the rapid urbanization accompanied with the development of the industrial facilities. The main aim of the study was to shed light on using satellite data to detect the concentration of the primary air pollutants including NO2, SO2, and CO to constitute a pre-defensive step to control and improve the air quality in Saudi Arabia. The present study examined using Sentinel-5 Precursor, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) satellite data to investigate and detect the air pollution parameters in the study area rather than using the traditional measurements from ground stations. The analysis of satellite images revealed an increase in the concentration of air pollution parameters compared to the standard limits of the WHO which can cause crucial negative impacts on the environment as well as human health. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to analyze the relation between various air pollutants with temperature and wind speed with values ranging between 0.0004 and 0.6604. The statistical analysis of air pollutants showed strong linear correlation that may by attributed to the same emission origin. CO and NO2 on roads have a strong correlation and are emitted by vehicles(R (Albugami et al., 2018) = 0.66). NO2 and CO do not seem to have strong correlation with either SO2 or AOD and their correlation coefficients are weaker, that indicating different emissions sources. The AOD in the study area originated mainly from the windblown dust, construction work, and suspension of particles and therefore do not emitted from traffic.},

Yet, many aspects of Earth’s biodiversity are not directly quantified by reflected or emitted photons. Inclusive integration of remote sensing with field-based ecology and evolution is needed to fully understand and preserve Earth’s biodiversity. In this Perspective, we argue that multiple data types are necessary for almost all draft targets set by the Convention on Biological Diversity. We examine five key topics in biodiversity science that can be advanced by integrating remote sensing with in situ data collection from field sampling, experiments and laboratory studies to benefit conservation. Lowering the barriers for bringing these approaches together will require global-scale collaboration. This Perspective discusses how the latest advances in remote sensing can be used to answer basic ecological and evolutionary questions, as well as contribute to important biodiversity monitoring.},
